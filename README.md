# danmaku-v
Danmaku Game written in V (https://github.com/vlang/v)

### ⚠ Project Development Discontinued ⚠
As V is still quite unstable or I am doing wrong to render or handling the objects update that somehow it won't run on Windows, but it run perfectly fine on Linux. I might continue this project after V is perfectly stable and the documentation is complete.

TODO: 
```
1. Add Graphics/Rendering Lib(?)
2. Add Collision Handler [DONE]
3. Add Projectiles Handler
4. Add Enemy Behaviour
5. Add Player Controller
6. Other necessary things that I currently didn't notices
```
